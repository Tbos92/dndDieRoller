# dndDieRoller

This project will start out simply by allowing a user to select what type of die they wish to use and how many. The dice optiones will be from the standard polyhedral set as used in TTRPG systems aking to Dungeons and Dragons (i.e. d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100). Results will be displayed both as a total value and itemized for the user to see.

Future goals:
1. Add functionality for the user to set a custom number of faces on the die they wish to select
2. Graphically represent the dice with 2D sprites/images displaying the itemized results on the faces of the individual dice with a total displayed up top
3. Add selectors for certain conditions such as but not limited to: Advantaged rolls (e.g. roll 2d20 and take the higher result), elemental adept where 1s rolled should be rerolled, or add a certain different die to the roll (e.g. Bless or Guidance adding 1d4 to a d20 roll or Bardic Inspiration)
4. Graphically represent the dice in a 3D-like manner, with rolling animations
5. Long term, this project could be integrated as a component to another project to automate a DnD character sheet and therefore pull ability modifiers straight out of the character sheet to automatically calculate total results for ability checks, saving throws, attack rolls, etc.
